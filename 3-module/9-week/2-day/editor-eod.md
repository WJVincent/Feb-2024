# Get to know your editor

## Programming is text processing

- file access
- i/o streams
- text manipulation
- writing actual code

Reducing the barrier between your thoughts and the page is a fantastic step in improving as a programmer. 

You don't need to be a fast typist or know your environment well to program, but it is massively helpful at increasing your comfort and productivity.

## Shortcuts and why you should use them

Regardless of what editor you use it is going to be absolutely full of useful shortcuts. You should be using them.

You are probably already aware of how in most editors it is much faster
and more convenient it is to type...

- <Ctrl-c>: copy
- <Ctrl-v>: paste
- <Ctrl-x>: cut

This is only the starting point of learning to make your editor work for you.
There are so many useful things you can do to make your coding life more efficient.
